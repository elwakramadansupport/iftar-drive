Perfect! Let me update the Google Script URL in your HTML file:Perfect! ✅ **URL Updated Successfully!**

## 🧪 **Test Your Setup:**

1. **First, test the Google Script directly:**
   - Open this URL in your browser: 
   ```
   https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxgmGgwEFODJr3Q6K9vwz8D706EBUqhZDJqMAyoDVNdl5sspJERk40V-lDgznI8R1rJ/exec
   ```
   - You should see: `{"ok":true,"total":0,"count":0}`
   - If you see anything else (error, login page), redeploy with **"Anyone"** access

2. **Then test the full flow:**
   - Open your HTML file
   - Select an amount (e.g., KSh 500)
   - Click **"I've Paid"**
   - Check your Google Sheet - you should see a new row with:
     - Date/Time
     - Amount (500)
     - Reference (e.g., ELW-250205-XXXX)

## ✨ **Everything Should Now Work:**
